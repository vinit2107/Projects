The document is about the exploratory analysis of the NOAA Storm Database. The dataset has been taken from this [link](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2FStormData.csv.bz2). The dataset defines the enviornmental events, like typhoon, thunderstorms, floods, flash floods etc. which have occured since 1950 till 2011. The dataset also describes the economical loss that each of the events have caused to the country. Count for the number of injuries and fatalities that have occured due to each event has been defined too. The project is aimed at deriving the relationships and insights from the dataset about the injuries, property damage and the determining which event is the most dangerous event.

Following are the observations from the analysis:

1. Thunderstorm and hail are the most frequent type of events across the country.
2. Flood and Hurricane are the events which cause the most property damage.
3. Tornado tops the list for the number of injuries and fatalities caused due to an
   event.
4. Heat which was not even in the top 10 events of the country, comes second to 
   tornado as the event with most number of fatalities.
5. Statewise analysis highlights the states with the most number of events. Texas,
   Kansas, Oklahoma, Missouri, Indiana and Nebraska have the most number of 
   incidents.
6. California which had relatively less count for number of events, tops the list 
   for the property damage at more than $120 billion.
7. The number of events has seen a rising trend since the dataset has been 
   maintained.
