Farmers' Market Analysis aims at anlaysing the farmer markets in the United States of America. 

A farmers' market is a physical retail marketplace intended to sell foods directly by farmers to consumers. Farmers' markets may be indoors or outdoors and typically consist of booths, tables or stands where farmers sell their homegrown produce, live animals and plants, and sometimes prepared foods and beverages.[Wikipedia]

The dataset for the analysis has been taken from the USDA website. The link to the dataset can be found [here](https://www.ams.usda.gov/local-food-directories/farmersmarkets). 

The project analyses the farmers' market in the following manner:

1. Identify the number of farmer markets. Each state is segregated according to the geographic location like Northeast, Midwest, North and South.

2. Determine the seasonality of the farmer's market. This section builds a time series plot of the markets from the year 2012 to year 2020.

3. Analyse the type of food products available in the farmers' market.

4. Analyse the payment methods available in the market for transaction.

5. Identify if there is a trend in the organic and meat products sold in the market.

The project has been completed in rmd and the rendered pdf and html output are available for validation.
